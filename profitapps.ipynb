    "We only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that the number of users of our apps determines our revenue for any given app â€” the more users who see and engage with the ads, the better. Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users."
