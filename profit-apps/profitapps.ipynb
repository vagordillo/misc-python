This means that the number of users of our apps determines our revenue for any given app â€” the more users who see and engage with the ads, the better. Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users.\n",

    "* A [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps) containing data about approximately 10,000 Android apps from Google Play; the data was collected in August 2018.

    "* A [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps) containing data about approximately 7,000 iOS apps from the App Store; the data was collected in July 2017.
